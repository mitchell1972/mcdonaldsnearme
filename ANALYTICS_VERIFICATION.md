# Vercel Analytics Implementation Verification

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### 1. Package Installation ✅
- **Package**: `@vercel/analytics` 
- **Version**: 1.5.0
- **Location**: Listed in `package.json` dependencies

### 2. Component Integration ✅
- **Import Statement**: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
- **Location**: `src/main.tsx`
- **Implementation**: Correctly using `/react` import (not `/next` which is for Next.js)
- **Component Placement**: Added within `React.StrictMode` wrapper

### 3. Code Implementation ✅
```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'

root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
    <Analytics />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

### 4. Production Deployment ✅
- **Deployed**: Yes, to production
- **Domain**: https://mcdonaldsnearme.store
- **Build System**: Vite with React

### 5. Bundle Verification ✅
- **Analytics Code Present**: Confirmed in bundled JavaScript
- **Bundle File**: `/assets/index-CL1KRKzY.js`
- **Script Endpoint**: `/_vercel/insights/script.js`
- **SDK Version**: 1.5.0

### 6. Expected Behavior
Once deployed and users visit the site, you should see:
- Network requests to `/_vercel/insights/view` when pages are viewed
- Data appearing in the Vercel Analytics dashboard after a few visits
- Real-time tracking of:
  - Page views
  - Unique visitors
  - Browser/device information
  - Geographic data
  - Performance metrics

### 7. How to View Analytics Data
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `mcdonalds-directory`
3. Click on the **Analytics** tab
4. Data will appear after users have visited your site

### 8. Troubleshooting
If you don't see data immediately:
- Analytics may take a few minutes to start collecting data
- Ad blockers can prevent analytics from loading in development
- Ensure you have Analytics enabled in your Vercel project settings
- Check the browser's Network tab for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests

### Summary
✅ All requirements from the Vercel Analytics documentation have been properly implemented:
1. Package installed via pnpm
2. Analytics component added to the React app (using correct `/react` import)
3. App deployed to Vercel production
4. Analytics code confirmed in production bundle

The implementation is complete and Analytics should be tracking visitor data on https://mcdonaldsnearme.store
